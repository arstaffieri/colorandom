This is a website that will generate random color palettes, allow a user to save color palettes, and allow a user to delete saved color palettes. It will also allow a user to lock favorite colors so they stay when the "new palette button" is clicked.

#### Installation Instructions:

#### Learning Goals:
- Write semantic HTML and efficient CSS to form a usable UI
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript and leverage classes, creating and using an effective data model
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
- Refine your collaboration skills


#### Wins + Challenges:
- Win - We got through all of the iterations of the project and are able to delete palettes.
- Challenge - We were challenged because, at one point in the project, we realized we were going down the wrong path and not using the entire class. We had to backtrack and redo some of our code so that we were using the entire class, generating a unique ID, and were able to continue from there.
